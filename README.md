I developed a clone of LinkedIn's homepage using HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the layout and design of LinkedIn's interface to enhance my front-end development skills. This project involved:

HTML Structure: I created a semantic and well-organized HTML structure to mirror the different sections of the LinkedIn homepage, such as the header, navigation bar, feed, and sidebar.
CSS Styling: I used CSS to style the elements, ensuring that the design was as close to the original as possible. This included working with different CSS properties to manage layout, typography, colors.
